include all files in the project directory to be read by the main.c

include the following in the main file
#include "FreeRTOS.h"
#include "task.h"

(You may need to include "FreeRTOSConfig.h" as well)

IMPORTANT: in the FreeRTOSConfig.h, 
put #define configUSE_IDLE_HOOkÂ to 0 instead of 1 (in case you use the kernel downloaded from the freertos site)

You are now using FreeRTOS Kernel on ATMega323, start coding! :D
